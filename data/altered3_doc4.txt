The risk of cybercrime has become a global issue affecting almost all countries. Salifu (2008) believes that the Internet is a "double-edged sword". It provides many opportunities for the development and prosperity of individuals and organizations, and it also opens up new opportunities. For example, financial crimes related to Nigeria are very common. Out of 138 countries, 122 countries complained about Nigeria�s involvement in financial fraud activities in their country at INTERPOL meetings.The type that office workers all over the world use every day is the so-called prepaid scam.

A major problem on a global scale has caused many new types of criminal activities and actors, and therefore many new challenges in dealing with this new threat (Picard, 2009).Cybercrime is a knowledge-intensive problem because many types of cybercrime are innovative. Cyberspace is a new and challenging field in the fields of criminology, police science, law enforcement and surveillance. Virtual reality and computer communications pose challenges to traditional criminology and police affairs. , Introducing new forms of rejection, crime and social control. Since the 1990s, scientists and professionals have been paying attention to cyberspace as a new field of criminal activity.Cyberspace is changing the nature and extent of crime and victimization. A new discipline called cybercrime is emerging. Jaishankar (2007) defines cybercrime as the study of the causal relationship of cyberspace crime and its impact on physical space.
Most cybercrimes are committed by the employees of the organization, and the crimes occur within the company (Hagen et al., 2008; Nykodym et al., 2005). However, from the perspective of financial crime introduced in this chapter, we define cybercrime as cybercrime. Commercial crime, rather than crime, eliminates the traditional focus of angry and frustrated employees trying to hurt employers.
Computer crime is defined as a violation of the criminal law, requiring knowledge of computer technology to be investigated, or prosecuted (Laudon and Laudon, 2010). The original role of information and communication technology is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. The pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness is even darker because fraudsters use electronic measurement to obtain personal gain.He brought many new types of crimes (Picard, 2009). Examples of cybercrime include sabotage, computer piracy, and identity theft (Pickett and Pickett, 2002). In cybercrime terms, the term "cracker" is often used to refer to hackers. No one knows the severity of the cybercrime problem: how many systems were attacked, how many people were involved, or the overall economic loss.Cybercrime is a denial of service attack that can forward customer orders to other vendors. Eleven individuals in five countries/regions are among the most serious thefts in credit card fraud (Laudon and Laudon, 2010: 326): The U.S. Attorney�s Office has prosecuted 11 individuals in five countries/regions, including the United States, Ukraine and China.

They sold credit card numbers online and printed other stolen numbers on the magnetic strips of blank cards so they could withdraw thousands of dollars from ATM machines. Miami's Albert Gonzalez (Albert Gonzalez) was appointed as the main ring organizer.
The conspirators started their biggest robbery in July 2005 when they discovered an infected network in the Marshall department store in Miami and used the network to install sniffer software on computers owned by the network's parent company TJX. They have access to the central TJX database, which stores customer transactions for T. Marxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and A. Wright stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and Winners and HomeSense stores in Canada.Fifteen months later, TJX reported that the attackers stole as many as 45 million credit and debit card records. TJX is still using the old Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption system, which can be cracked relatively easily by hackers. The more secure WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) standard with more complex encryption, and TJX is not. The examiner later discovered that TJX had also forgotten to install firewalls and data encryption on many computers over the wireless network.TJX admitted in the SEC filing that it transmitted credit card information to the bank without encryption, which violated the regulations of the credit card company. Any criminal activity involving computers and networks, where the computer plays a role in the criminal activity. Internet crime, like the third crime label, involves criminal use of the Internet.We believe that computer networks or equipment promote commercial crime, and its main goal is not computer networks and equipment, but independent of computer networks or equipment.
Cybercrime is a term used to describe an attack on the network security infrastructure of a company organization that may have multiple targets. One of the goals of criminals is to gain unauthorized access to the victim's confidential information. Most companies rely heavily on their proprietary information, including information about new products and employment opportunities. Records, price lists and sales figures are according to Gallaher et al. (2008) Can get the attackerObtaining such information and/or its sales may bring direct economic benefits, or may harm the organization through influence.
